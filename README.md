# prebellico
Passive internal reconnaissance tool

Prebellico in its simplest form is a 100% passive network reconnaissance tool designed to gather as much information about the target environment without transmission. Execution is simple. Simply launch Prebellico with python as a root user at startup or within a GNU Screen session and the information it gathers will be dumped to the screen as well as logged within a specific location. By default Prebellio will only operate in a 100% passive state, while working to ignore traffic generated by the sniffing interface. If more specific functionality is desired, simply leverage the various options built into Prebellico:

root@soluto:~# python ./prebellico.py -h<br />
usage: prebellico.py [-h] [-i INF] [-f FILE] [-l LOG] [-d DB] [-e EXTRA][-t TARGETS] [-w WAIT] [-s] [-p] [-a] [-q]

Note that Prebellico has the ability to process a PCAP file with a maximum SNAPLEN of 262144 bytes prior to an engagement. This is useful for things like processing historical data obtained elsewhere or for scope validation purposes prior to engagement kickoff. You can also merge this data during the engagement by copying the database over and specifying the database and logfile at launch time, if so desired.

Soon prebellico will start to track the time between intelligence updates, and if so desired, work to move into a semi-passive mode after a user defined period of lack of intelligence, or after a specific period, leveraging the information it has obtained to further enumerate resources within the environment.

Prebellico also has the ability to understand what is permitted within the environment from network egress point. Eventually Prebellico, if told to do so, will leverage this information and establish a C2 connection using observed egress patters to report back to a listener the information it knows about a network.
